# merge or die, a ludum dare 55 entry

## basic mechanics

- [x] 2D matrix of M * N sprites
- [x] there's a progression of sprites, let's say they're powers of 2, 2 > 4 > ... > 2048
- [ ] the theme is a bit dark
- goal:
    - [ ] merge all the way to 2048 (sprite theme ~> lovely pet to wild beast?)
- penalties:
    - [ ] timer running down to 0. when it reach 0, some of the board tiles get added back
    - [ ] there may also be a meter adding mistakes, once full you summon a demon which will penalize you some other way?
- scoring:
    - [ ] time spent to finish the game - number of matches done
